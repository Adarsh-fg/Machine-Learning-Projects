# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects  

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects Repository**!  

This repository is a comprehensive collection of EDA projects focused on uncovering insights, patterns, and relationships within datasets. It encompasses tasks involving **regression** (predicting continuous outcomes) and **classification** (categorizing data into discrete classes), offering a versatile foundation for data analysis and machine learning workflows.  

## üîç What Is Exploratory Data Analysis?  
EDA is the process of analyzing and summarizing datasets to extract actionable insights. It serves as a critical step in data science workflows, enabling:  
- Identification of patterns, anomalies, and trends.  
- Assessment of data quality and structure.  
- Formulation of hypotheses for further analysis.  
- Preparation of data for machine learning models.  

## üõ† Tools and Techniques Used  
This repository employs a wide array of tools and techniques to ensure thorough data exploration and preparation:  
- **Languages and Libraries**:  
  - Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn.  
  - Optional: Advanced libraries like XGBoost, LightGBM for deeper analysis.  
- **Data Handling**:  
  - Cleaning missing or erroneous values.  
  - Identifying and removing outliers.  
  - Scaling and normalizing data for better model performance.  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Static visualizations: Bar charts, scatter plots, histograms.  
  - Interactive visualizations: Using libraries like Plotly.  
  - Heatmaps, pair plots, and feature importance charts to uncover hidden relationships.  
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Creating new features from existing data.  
  - Encoding categorical variables.  
  - Dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional datasets.  
- **Modeling**:  
  - Regression: Predicting numerical values with techniques like linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.  
  - Classification: Categorizing data into classes using models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests.  
- **Evaluation**:  
  - Performance metrics like RMSE, MAE for regression and accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall for classification tasks.
