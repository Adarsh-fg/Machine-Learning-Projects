# Used Cars Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on a used cars dataset. The analysis aims to uncover insights, trends, and patterns in the data to support decision-making and recommendations.

## Problem Statement
Understanding the dynamics of the used car market and identifying key factors that influence car pricing and demand.

## Objective
The main objective of this analysis is to:
- Explore the dataset to understand the key features and distributions.
- Identify relationships between variables that affect car pricing.
- Provide actionable insights for businesses and individuals in the used car market.

## Project Structure
The notebook includes the following sections:
1. **Problem Statement** - Overview of the problem and goals of the analysis.
2. **Objective** - Detailed objectives and expected outcomes.
3. **Importing Libraries** - Loading required Python libraries.
4. **Loading the Dataset** - Data ingestion and preview.
5. **Basic Understanding** - Initial exploration of the dataset.
6. Additional steps, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Dataset
The analysis is performed on a dataset containing information about used cars, such as:
