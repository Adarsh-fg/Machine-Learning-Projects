## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Diamonds dataset. It explores relationships between various attributes of diamonds, such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and price. Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to identify patterns and trends.

---

## Dataset Description

The Diamonds dataset contains the following key features:  

- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond  
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)  
- **Color**: Diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best)  
- **Clarity**: Measurement of diamond clarity (I1 (worst) to IF (best))  
- **Price**: Price in USD  
- **X, Y, Z**: Dimensions of the diamond in mm  
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage = (Z / mean(X, Y)) * 100  
- **Table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point  

---

## Key Findings

- **Price vs. Carat**: A strong positive correlation exists between diamond weight and price.  
- **Cut Impact**: Ideal and Premium cuts command higher prices on average.  
- **Color and Clarity**: Higher clarity and better color grades significantly influence the price.  
- **Depth & Table**: Moderate impact on pricing; diamonds with balanced proportions tend to cost more.  

Detailed findings and visualizations can be found in the [EDA notebook](DiamondsEDA.ipynb).
