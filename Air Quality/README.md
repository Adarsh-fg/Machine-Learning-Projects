# **Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning**
## **Regression Model**

This project is a comprehensive exploration of air quality data, designed to analyze historical pollutant levels and build machine learning models for predicting Air Quality Index (AQI). By combining data-driven insights and predictive modeling, this project helps to understand the factors influencing air quality and make informed decisions for better environmental management.

## **Introduction**

Air pollution is a critical issue affecting public health and the environment. Understanding and predicting air quality is essential for timely interventions and policy-making. This project takes a data science approach to analyze pollutant trends and predict AQI using historical data. The analysis includes pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and others, which significantly impact air quality. The project is structured to perform data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning to provide accurate predictions.

## **Project Objectives**

1. **Analyze Historical Trends**: Understand temporal and spatial variations in pollutant levels.  
2. **Identify Key Factors**: Determine which pollutants most significantly affect air quality.  
3. **Build Predictive Models**: Use machine learning techniques to predict AQI based on pollutant concentrations.  
4. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Help policymakers and researchers identify patterns for effective air quality management.

## **Steps in the Project**

### **1. Dataset Exploration**
The dataset includes multiple features like `PM2.5`, `PM10`, `CO`, `NO`, and others. The first step involves understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset, including data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA provides deeper insights into the data:
- **Visualizing Pollutant Levels**: Trends over time, seasonal patterns, and regional differences.  
- **Identifying Relationships**: Correlations between pollutants and AQI.  
- **Detecting Anomalies**: Outliers and missing data that require handling.

### **3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Preparing the data for modeling includes:
- Handling missing values with imputation techniques.  
- Removing irrelevant or redundant features.  
- Scaling features to ensure uniformity for machine learning models.  

### **4. Feature Selection**
Correlation analysis is used to identify the most relevant features. This step ensures the model focuses on impactful variables while avoiding redundancy.

### **5. Predictive Modeling**
Using machine learning techniques like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and others, the project builds models to predict AQI. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics like RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## **Key Insights from EDA**

1. **Seasonal Trends**: Higher pollution levels are observed in specific months, often coinciding with winter or high industrial activity.  
2. **Critical Pollutants**: Pollutants like `PM2.5`, `PM10`, and `CO` show a strong correlation with AQI.  
3. **Outliers and Missing Data**: Outlier removal and handling missing values were critical in ensuring reliable predictions.
